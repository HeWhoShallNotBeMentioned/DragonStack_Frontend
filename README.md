Description
\*{A game to collect and breed dragons. This is a fullstack JavaScript application. The front end consists of a signup/sign page, a home page that shows the current generation and account information, an Account Dragons page that lists all of the dragons owned by the logged in account, and Public dragons that are available for purchase or mating. The backend consists of relational database that store all of the dragon and account informtion. Communication is provided to the front end via 3 routes that 13 different apis total.

Dragons have an id, nickname, generation, background color, pattern, build, size, saleValue, sireValue,and isPublic values. There is a dragon avatar based on the physical attributes.

User accounts have dragons, cash balance, and Username. Each user can generate one dragon per generation.

Authenticattion is done with session cookies which have an experation date but can be stored on multiple devices and are persistent through refreshes. The session cookied are also used as the authentication on selected APIs.

{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}

Known Bugs
{ The application works as intended but there are lots of places for improvement. For example the user accounts are not tied to email. The application is not realtime so it is possible one user can purchase a dragon and another still thinks it is available. }
